### What is the goal of this presentation?

--

- Give you some guidelines that will your analysis __easier to understand__ and __easier to reproduce__ by others:

--

    - Colleagues
    - Opposing parties
    - Yourself in the future

--

- This guidelines also aim at providing __consistency__, which reduces the __cognitive overload__ in each stage of the analysis.

--

    - Where is the raw data? 
    - Where did I put the code to produce Figure 7?
    - Was this analysis based on the latest data?

--

- Implementing these rules comes at a __cost__, therefore we hope to implement __"good-enough"__ practices, that allow us to ensure the quality of our work without unessesary hassle costs.

# Good-enough practices
That you should __always__ try to follow

(_regardless_ of your programming language)

---

class: my-larger-font

## Rules of thumb...

--

1. `r ji("dancing_men")` Ensure reproducibility

--

2. `r ji("woman_cartwheeling")` Respect the workflow

--

3. `r ji("floppy_disk")` Respect our naming conventions

--

4. `r ji("memo")` Document your code and analysis

--

5. `r ji("man_dancing")` Adopt a coding style

---

### `r ji("dancing_men")` Reproducibility

--

`r ji("x")` Change the names of the files shared with us by clients or lawyers.

--

`r ji("x")` Modify files *without* a script.

--

`r ji("x")` Change the folder structure inside a contract's main directory without checking with others working in the same case.

--

`r ji("x")` Forget to update your scripts if you have changed the name of files, or of the paths leading to those files.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshots for each one of these. -->
<!-- TODO: Add more gotchas. Link to tweet. -->

---

### `r ji("dancing_men")` Reproducibility

--

`r ji("heavy_check_mark")` Make sure the scripts, inputs and outputs of your analysis are on the server.

--

`r ji("heavy_check_mark")` State at the beginning of your scripts the file paths to your inputs and outputs.

--

`r ji("heavy_check_mark")` Use R and Stata's different tools ensure your outputs are coherent with your code:

- R's [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
- Stata's [`esttab/estout`](http://repec.sowi.unibe.ch/stata/estout/).

---

### `r ji("woman_cartwheeling")` Workflow

--
#### .large[`r ji("confused")` What is it?]
--

It refers to the ***way*** in which you work on data analysis projects, either by yourself or with others.

For example:

--

- The *way* you organise your folders.

--

- The *way* you name your scripts.

--

- The *way* you share your changes or updates with others.

--

- The *way* you handle repetitive tasks.

---

### `r ji("woman_cartwheeling")` Workflow

--

#### .large[`r ji("raised_eyebrow")` Why should you care?]

--

- It helps you ensure **reproducibility**.

--

- It makes it easier to **spot and fix** mistakes.

--

- It makes you more **efficient**.

--

#### .large[`r ji("sweat_smile")` ...but is it going to be hard to learn?]

--

- You probably already have your *own* workflow, which you have developed from your own experiences.

--

- Here we are suggesting a **common** workflow that we have developed from our joint experience working on cases.

--

- We have **written it down**, so you can take advantage its benefits know instead of having to learn these lessons the hard way.

---

### `r ji("woman_cartwheeling")` Workflow

--

#### .large[`r ji("floppy_disk")` Organisation]

--

`r ji("page_facing_up")` Scripts should be left in the top-level project directory. All other inputs and outputs should be sorted into 5 sub-directories:

--

- `r ji("file_folder")` **data-raw** -- Raw data sent by lawyers or clients.

--

- `r ji("file_folder")` **data** -- Data files produced from the scripts in the top-level directory. Preferred formats are `.RDS` and `.dta`

--

- `r ji("file_folder")` **figures** -- Figures produced from the scripts. Preferred format is `.png`.

--

- `r ji("file_folder")` **tables** -- Summary tables or excerpts of the data produced for intermediary exchanges with third parties. Generally in `.xlsx` format.

--

- `r ji("file_folder")` **memos** -- Data reports in `.Rmd`, `.docx`, `.pdf` or `.html` format. These are often the dynamic outputs of RMarkdown documents.

--

- `r ji("file_folder")` **shiny** -- Code for one or more Shiny apps.

```

---

### `r ji("woman_cartwheeling")` Workflow

We are beginning to use **Git**, a version control system, and **GitLab**, a Git-repository manager, for our data analysis projects. Before your first project with Git, make sure you read:

1. [Our documentation on GitLab](i/am/a/fake/path)
2. [The slides of our internal trainings](i/am/a/fake/path)
3. [happygitwithr.com](https://happygitwithr.com/) `r ji("star")` * Highly recommended, even for non-R users*

### `r ji("floppy_disk")` Good names



[Three principles for file names](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files) of [@JennyBryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) state that file names should:

1. Be machine readable
2. Be human readable
3. Play well will default ordering

### `r ji("floppy_disk")` Good names
#### .large[`r ji("point_up")` 1. Machine readable]

- Work well with [**regular expressions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

- Should not contain accents, special characters or spaces.

- Should preferably be in the same case.

### `r ji("floppy_disk")` Good names
#### .large[ `r ji("love_you")` 3. Play well with default ordering]

- Scripts should be numbered if they need to be run in a given order.

- Think about left-padding the numbers with `0`.

- Dates should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` (international standard) or in the format `YYMMDD`, which is the style we have adopted in our reports.

### `r ji("memo")` Documentation

#### .large[`r ji("sparkles")` The **README**]

- A [`README`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) file contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software.

- The main goal of the README files is to make it easier for *anyone* in the team to understand the logistics around the analyses that were carried out.

#### .large[`r ji("woman_shrugging")` How to write a **good** README?]

- Assume that you, the author, is not around to explain it!

- What are the main messages you would like to leave to your colleagues?

### `r ji("dancing_men")` Style

#### .large[`r ji("sparkles")` The tidyverse style guide]

Why this style guide and not others?

- It is becoming a standard given the popularity of R's tidyverse packages.
- Can be implemented with the [`styler`](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) package.
- Same principles can be applied to other coding languages.

# Good-enough practices
For Stata

---

### Use globals and relative paths

- Use **globals** to store the paths to different directories.

- You could also try using Stata's [Project Manager](https://www.stata.com/manuals/pprojectmanager.pdf), which allows you to use **relative paths** in a way similar to RStudio.

- Your paths should always appear at the top of your script.

.small[
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
/* Paths */

global proj   "O:/27 - EA/NAME OF CASE/Data/"
global raw    "$proj" + "data-raw"
global data   "$proj" + "data"
global tables "$proj" + "tables"

cd "$raw"

/* Code used to import and transform the data */

cd "$results"

/* Code with results */

```
]

---

### Where should you start?

- Learn how to explore data.
  - Read up on `codebook`, `describe`, `inspect` and `list`.

- Learn about loops (`foreach`, `foreval`).

- Global and local macros.

- Learn to deal with __dates__ and __strings__.

# Good-enough practices
For R & RStudio

---

## Our R toolkit

--
__R__ is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. You can download the latest version from the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) website.

--

__RStudio__ is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming. You can download the open source Desktop version from the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) website.

--

__Packages__ are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. The directory where packages are stored is called the library.

--

The __tidyverse__ is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying philosophy and common APIs.

---

## Setting up RStudio

`Tools -> Global Options -> General`

```{r out.width="400px", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/global-opts-rdata.PNG")
```

---

## Setting up RStudio

`Tools -> Global Options -> Code -> Display`

```{r out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/global-opts-margins.PNG")
```

---

## Setting up RStudio

`Tools -> Global Options -> Code -> Saving`

```{r out.width = "400px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/global-opts-encoding.PNG")
```

---

### What is a working directory?

The __working directory__ is where R looks for files that you ask it to load, and where it will put any files that you ask it to save.

You can print your working directory by running `getwd()`:

```{r getwd, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
getwd()
```

You can change the working directory within R by running `setwd()`. 

```{r setwd, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
setwd("C:/Users/mcaldasrivera/Desktop/")
```

---

### Advice from the masters

Changing the working directory is **bad form**. Work with projects instead.

---

## Using RStudio Projects

A project looks like this:

```{r out.width = "450px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/project0.PNG")
```

---

## Using RStudio Projects

The working directory of a project can look like this:

```{r project2, out.width = "550px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/project2.PNG")
```

---

## Using RStudio Projects
#### Alternatives to `setwd()` and `rm(list = ls())`

The recommended workflow goes something like this:

*  `r ji("point_up")` Launch RStudio from your R Project. This is a file ends with `.Rproj`.

* `r  ji("v")` Open your script, make your edits, run your code.

Want to run code from another script? Then:

* `r  ji("love_you")` Restart R with `Ctrl + Shift + F10`

* `r  ji("vulcan_salute")` Run your new script.

**Pro-tip:** To run an entire script (a.k.a *source* a script), you can use `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`.


---

### What are paths?

An __absolute path__ is the location of a directory relative to the root directory. Some examples of absolute paths:

```r
"O:/25 - Microeconomix/Contrats/ClientXYZ"
"C:/Users/mcaldasrivera/Desktop/Formations R"
```

<br>

A __relative path__ is the location of a directory relative to the working directory. They look like this:

```r
"data-raw"         # Sub-directory data-raw
"../Administratif" # One up from working directory
```
